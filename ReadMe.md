Backbone Drag and Drop Playground
==================================
This is my drag and drop examples, using the awesomeness of backbone.

Like all of my spare time projects, it will probably come to nothing, lets have a go.

TODO's
=======
1. Get basic Sinatra app running that can serialise ruby objects and spit out the json
2. Get a basic backbone app running where you can see the serialised elements
3. Play with jquery drag drop
4. Get drag drop working with the elements of a single collection
5. Save the result via a POST
6. Get drag and drop working between collections
